## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through developing this solution, I was given freedom to experiment with a layout which required a full CSS Grid layout, while also gaining confidence in efficient use of Flexbox as required. I developed my skills further using a BEM approach to site development, with well-documented code throughout. The project provided me with an opportunity to build a relatively complex responsive layout, with a mobile-first consideration taken at every step.

### Continued development

I would like to use this project as a basis for developing my skillset further within CSS Grid and general layout builds, while also furthering my understanding of how best to build user interface elements and interaction with CSS & JavaScript in general.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Furthered my understanding of how to build CSS Grid layouts, while also assisting with transforming my previous jQuery-based mobile menu into a vanilla JavaScript example.
